#YUGO

Yugo allows you to find locations for any service you may need. You will also be able to find directions from your location to that of said service. 

###Instructions

* On the hoempage, type in your current location (Ex. 'Stuyvesant High School' or '345 Chambers Street') and a query for a venue you'd like to visit ('pizza', 'movies', etc.) Then press Submit. 

* If your address is invalid, YUGO returns an Internal Server Error. If YUGO cannot find any locations corresponding to your query, it will not return any results. 

* Provided that both of the above requirements are met, YUGO will return a list of locations matching your query, along with their addresses. Clicking on any of the blue boxes surrounding each link will redirect you to a Directions page. 

* On the Directions page, you will see a map centered around your current location. By selecting a Mode of Travel from the panel at the top of the page (Walking, Driving, Bicycling, or Transit), you will be given directions from your location to the location you clicked on while on the Results page. The map will show the route, and the directions will appear on the right-hand side of the page. 

*At any time you can also click on the "Home" or "About Us" links on the navigation bar to either return to the homepage or learn more about YUGO, respectively.
